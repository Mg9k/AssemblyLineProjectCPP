# AssemblyLineProjectCPP

This program takes customer orders from a text file and fills out the order by putting it through an assembly line. The assembly line is composed of workstations and a line manager, which contains the workstations. The information for both of the above is pulled from a text file. The customer's orders are pushed through the assembly line, where the items within the orders are processed at their respective station.
